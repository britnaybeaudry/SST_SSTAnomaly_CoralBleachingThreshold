# Sea Surface Temperature, SST Anomaly, and Coral Bleaching Threshold
This code explores sea surface temperature, sea surface temperature anomaly, and the coral bleaching threshold for a given area. The code is currently set for Southern Florida in July 2023, but users can change the geometry, start/end date, and point of interest to view other areas.

The data sources are as follows:

Sea Surface Temperature: 
* GCOM-C/SGLI L3 Sea Surface Temperature (V2)
* GCOM-C/SGLI L3 Sea Surface Temperature (V3)

The methodology sources are as follows:
* Anomaly calculation: [NASA GSFC Anomalies Analysis of Soil Moisture and Precipitation Over a River Basin](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/anomalies-analysis-smo-and-pre)
* Coral Bleaching Threshold and Heat Stress: [NOAA Coral Reef Watch Bleaching Threshold](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/education/tutorial/crw22_bleachingthreshold.php)
